Data Scientist
Abtrace
London, England, United Kingdom
Abtrace is transforming the way patients are treated at their General Practice (GP) by leveraging data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to identify which tests or treatments a patient with a long-term health condition might benefit from.

By acting as an intelligent layer on top of the EHR, the system suggests actions based on an individual’s medical history, prompting proactive early interventions and spotting trends that might otherwise be missed.
