Data Engineer - Digital Health
electronRx
Cambridge, England, United Kingdom
At electronRx, we are building the interface between technology and the human body that will usher in a new therapeutic paradigm, transforming how we deliver healthcare and treat disease.

As a data engineer, you will be expected to take ownership of the data infrastructure and to work closely with our data science team. We are looking for someone with experience in building out cloud-based data infrastructure for business cases and a keenness to apply this to digital health; someone who can take on the responsibility of building a robust ecosystem of digital services in one of today's most complex data landscapes in digital medicine.

In your role you'll have the freedom to design and implement cloud infrastructure from ground up as you see fit. At electronRx, we prize ideas over egos, so if you can articulate and explain your reasoning we'll listen and support you all the way. You will help design and build a novel infrastructure of scalable services that will power a suite of biometric data collection and ML processing tools. You will be expected to develop an understanding of the whole pipeline, therefore getting a privileged overview of the digital health ecosystem.

We are mostly remote working at the moment and may be able to accommodate permanent or semi-permanent remote working for the right candidate.
