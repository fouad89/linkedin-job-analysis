Appreciation of the benefits of a structured software engineering environment and good documentation of processes
The ability to design, implement and use simple database structures to ensure data is organised effectively across the environment (relational databases, non-relational, distributed file system)
The ability to understand the pitfalls in different data sources and to perform the necessary provenance and lineage checks
Ability to write deliverables/reports in a clear, concise and appropriate way and communicate them
A passion for quality software coding, data and analytics and a good knowledge of statistics
Desire to work collaboratively with fellow associates, both in the Client and Internal Services Model, and to show commitment to exceptional delivery
