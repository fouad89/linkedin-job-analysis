Tessian protects every business‚Äôs mission by securing the human layer üí´

We're building intelligent security that works for human beings as they are, not how security policies would like them to be. Using machine learning technology, Tessian automatically predicts and eliminates advanced threats on email caused by human error - like data exfiltration, accidental data loss, business email compromise and phishing attacks - with minimal disruption to employees' workflow. As a result, employees are empowered to do their best work, without security getting in their way.

Tessian has raised a $65m Series C led by renowned security investors, March Capital (Crowdstrike, Knowbe4), with follow-on from Sequoia, Accel, Balderton, Latitude & Schroder Adveq, to further our mission to secure the human layer.

Founded in 2013, Tessian is backed by world-class venture capital investors, has hubs in London, San Francisco, Boston, and Austin, and London, and is one of the Top-3 2021 Best Places to Work for Women.

Data Science at Tessian

Our mission is to secure the human layer. This involves deploying near real-time machine learning models at massive scale to some of the world‚Äôs largest organisations to keep their most sensitive data private and secure. To do this, we're looking for a data scientist ready to work on hard problems, drive best practice and cultivate an environment of experimentation and learning.

Role

Companies can leverage data science in a number of ways, and we think the role of a Data Scientist falls into three distinct categories
You work for a business function analysing & reporting on how to improve a key metric, e.g increasing user conversion
You are responsible for writing production models to enhance the main product, e.g recommendation systems for e-commerce
You build the product - without machine learning, it wouldn't exist
The Data Science team built the product at Tessian. We couldn't exist without our machine learning models; they are at the heart of what we do, and they are what our clients rely on day-to-day. We're searching for a Senior Data Scientist who is excited about the opportunities and challenges that come with researching, building and deploying real-time production models.

On a Day To Day Basis, You'll Get To
Work across massive enterprise email datasets
Train and deploy models to production that impacts directly our customers and products
Improve our ML workflow
Work closely with our Engineering and Product Team to enhance our products.
Make your mark on ambitious projects
We'd love to meet someone who:
1+ years Data Science experience
Can balance longer term projects alongside impactful quick wins
Cares deeply about the impact their team has
Is creative at heart, and can encourage novel ways of thinking in their team. This has always been a core part of the data science team‚Äôs DNA
Reads Rules of Machine Learning - Martin Zinkevich and it resonates with how they think about machine learning and data science
Enjoys ‚Äúgetting their hands dirty‚Äù by digging into complex operations
Has strong listening skills; open to input from other team members and departments
Has worked with, or understands the principles behind working with data at scale
Why we think you'll love it here üòç....
