Data Scientist/Bioinformatics Scientist - Cambridge – UK

Why Us

Illumina’s mission is to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. We produce technology for DNA sequencing and genetic analysis. Our customers use our products to drive advancements in cancer research, diagnosis of rare genetic diseases and other research and clinical applications. A recent example is the global use of our technology in tracking Coronavirus variants during the ongoing pandemic. We are all deeply passionate about what we do, knowing that our work has the power to improve human health and lives across the world.

Why You

The Systems Analysis team in our R&D organisation helps to deliver the highest performance technology that enables our customers to carry out genomics analysis, such as enabling them to detect cancer at low levels or find antibiotic resistant bacteria in environmental samples. In our group we have people from different disciplines, such as physics, genetics, optics and mathematics. On a day-to-day basis we work with large and diverse datasets using existing tools and methods or developing new ones to help solve problems and gain understanding of complex interactions. We have an open and collaborative culture that works closely with scientists from engineering, chemistry and life sciences at our new state-of-the-art facility, just south of Cambridge.

If you want to push boundaries and join a culture fueled by innovation, collaboration and openness, this role could be for you. If you want a brilliant, fast-paced, mission-driven environment, then Illumina is the place for you.

The role

Communicating and collaborating with scientists from different disciplines across multiple sites
Analysing, integrating, modelling and interpreting experimental data
Translating analysis results into practical recommendations for technology development
Prototyping numerical analysis methods and/or implementing numerical algorithms
Developing methods for image analysis or signal processing
Preferred Background, Skills And Experience

Applied analysis and modelling of physical, chemical or abstract systems
Application of statistical inference in a research environment; for example, machine learning techniques or Bayesian inference
Research experience in numerical analysis, image or signal processing
Scientific software development experience and scripting, for example using Python, R or Matlab; familiarity with C++ or C would be advantageous
You should have a degree or PhD in natural sciences, engineering, mathematics, computer science, data science, bioinformatics or equivalent experience
