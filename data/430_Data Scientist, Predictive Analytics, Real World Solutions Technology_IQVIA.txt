We are looking for a collaborative, organised, intellectually curious and detail-oriented Data Scientist, with experience in applying machine learning methods to solve real-world problems with small teams, to join our London (Paddington) team. This is an exciting opportunity to work in one of the world's leading human data science teams, working with one of the largest medical healthcare datasets to help our clients answer specific questions, make more informed decisions and deliver results.

A typical day might include:

Working with the team and client to shape and develop requirements for answering ambitious life science questions (e.g. can we predict a rare disease diagnosis or an optimal dosing frequency in patients?)
Supporting projects being executed by our offshore India team of skilled data scientists, including discussing methodology questions, providing technical support, reviewing code and outputs, and coordinating with our client-facing consulting team in the US.
Addressing those requirements by developing and applying appropriate ETL processes (for feature creation from our raw data) and machine learning methodology (for constructing predictive models in an unbiased manner).
Researching machine learning techniques that could be used to improve our offering.
Communicating technical concepts and analytical outputs to a diverse set of stakeholders (internal and external).
Proactively identifying opportunities for innovation and areas for improvement across the workflow.

Ideally you will have:

Postgraduate degree or higher in a technical or scientific domain or experience working in a technical / consulting environment involving advanced analytics, preferably in a commercial setting.
Strong scientific programming skills (ideally in Python).
Prior experience in managing projects involving small technical teams.
Appetite for applying new and existing technologies to challenging problems in health care, i.e. motivated by solving the problem.
Knowledge and practical experience of applying supervised machine learning methods, such as regularised regression, ensemble tree-based models (e.g. xgboost) and deep learning methods.
Excellent organisation skills and ability to deliver results to deadlines.
Excellent communication skills, including ability to present technical concepts clearly (in writing, face-to-face discussions and on conference calls), write project analyses, pitch ideas effectively and persuasively to clients / internal stakeholders, etc.
A proactive, innovative and pragmatic approach to problem solving, and an ability to think critically and independently.
Ability to work collaboratively as part of a cross-functional team.

Bonus points for:


PySpark / big data experience.
Experience of code development in collaborative environments (e.g. doing code reviews through pull requests).
Knowledge of healthcare patient-level data.
Knowledge of epidemiology / biostatistics, particularly analytical issues relating to studies of treatment effectiveness, disease progression, adherence, healthcare utilisation, etc.
Knowledge of healthcare / life science issues.
