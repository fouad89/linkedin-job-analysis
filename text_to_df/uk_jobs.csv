We are collaborative, intellectually curious, entrepreneurial, and constantly looking for opportunities to harness the value of RWE in a constantly evolving industry.  IQVIA has adopted OMOP/OHDSI as a systematic and standardized approach to RWE. Data are converted into the OMOP Common Data Model, making queries and analytics interoperable and sharable. In addition, the generation of these queries and tools and its execution can be separated, both physically as well as logically, creating the opportunity to develop code for purposes of descriptive statistics or hypothesis testing in the absence of a direct data access to all data assets being targeted. As a consequence, the generation of insights becomes an industrialized process, including the characterization of data and the generation of insights.  The OMOP Productised Analytics team's mission is to deliver world class and globally scalable projects through:   Rapid analytics - to assess study feasibility and availability of data Standardised characterisations of the composition of a population: their demographic structure, the distribution of their comorbidities, the duration between diagnosis and intervention, etc. Protocol-driven analytics - estimating the association between clinical interventions and their outcomes – benefits and adverse events. Predictive models for determination of populations (phenotypes) or outcomes (patient-level predictions)  This requires global leadership across technical and data architecture, data manipulation, analytics script and report generation, software development and data visualization. The solutions are delivered to a variety of clients across life-science, government, payer or provider organizations. The team also curates the largest collection de-identified Real-World Data in the world in OMOP Common Data Model, from different patient care settings in multiple countries worldwide, making it the forefront of “Big Data” in healthcare.  In this role you can expect to;  Work on the development and implementation of solutions for retrospective research and analytics Support the building of a dedicated, enthusiastic team of data scientists Collaborate closely with both developers and data scientists, plus other team members such as Sales Professionals and IQVIA Data Teams to manage the development cycle from ‘thought to delivery’ Collaborate with members of the OHDSI community, participate in the OHDSI community through study projects such as study-a-thons, code development and knowledge sharing Build and maintain good relationships with clients through research projects Prepare rapid feasibility analysis to evaluate requirements for new and revised projects Translate detailed research specifications into documented instructions, debug routine queries and prepares necessary documentation Complete documentation and procedures for installation and maintenance of cohorts. Using current programming language and technologies, write code, complete programming, and perform testing and debugging of applications and queries Ad-hoc script writing in R, SQL, SAS.  Our ideal candidate will have;  Bachelor's Degree Computer Science or related discipline and experience of analysing healthcare data Advanced script writing in R and SQL Experience in manipulating and querying data at scale Good grasp of classical statistical methods, such as fitting regression models, inference testing and sampling. Exposure to epidemiology / biostatistics, particularly analytical issues relating to studies of treatment effectiveness, disease progression, adherence, healthcare utilization, Good knowledge of healthcare / life science issues involving Real-World Evidence or experience with patient-level, longitudinal data. A proactive, innovative and pragmatic approach to problem solving and an ability to think critically and independently. Flexible and adaptable in a client focused, results driven environment. Ability to manage team members effectively across multiple time-zones. Experience of a fast-paced, consultancy environment.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.  Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?  Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.  Who We Are Looking For Our Principal Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients. Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; differential privacy across billions of user IDs; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few. Principal Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring and technical leadership, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.  Who You Are You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing. You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources. You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making. You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates. You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.  What You Bring To The Table You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques. You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents. You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences. You have over 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it’s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have. You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.  The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk.
