Data Scientist - London
Product Madness üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
London, England, United Kingdom
At Product Madness you‚Äôll join one of the fastest growing mobile game development studios, ranked among the top 30 in the world. Since our start-up days, we‚Äôve tripled in size and stacked up awards for our chart-topping games such as Lightning Link and Heart of Vegas. How did we get here, you ask?

We follow our creative intuition focusing on quality and content to make world class games we‚Äôre passionate about. We know if we love the final product, our players will too.

We design games for all kinds of players, so we need all kinds of people creating them. We‚Äôve hired leading talent from over 30 nationalities and actively seek out those who bring something different to the table. This way we‚Äôre constantly learning from each other and collaborating on unique and exciting projects.

We also firmly believe that having fun together leads us to create better games. We are not an office where people keep to themselves ‚Äî we‚Äôre a family. Our dynamic as a team mixed with the freedom to work autonomously enables us to break boundaries and feel excited to come into work.
