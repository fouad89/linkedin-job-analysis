WANT FLEXIBILITY BUT WANT TO WORK ON ABSOLUTELY BEST IN CLASS DATA SCIENCE, ML, DL SOLUTIONS? HOW ABOUT A CONDENSED WEEK (HALF DAY FRIDAY - FOR A 5 DAY SALARY)?

My exclusive client is a market leader in their space. They're home to some of the most advanced DL products in Europe and they're continuing to expand. Their culture is fascinating - experimental, close knit & tailored to a remote & hybrid workforce.

You'll need PyTorch, Heavy Python, Tensorflow.... really advanced machine learning skills and an interest in AI!

In a Nut Shell?
I'm hiring a Data Scientist to work on cutting edge deep learning technologies applied to several industry applications. If you're keen to productionize data science models and really embed them into tangible use cases and drive product - then this is the company for you.

Remote Means Remote
Aside from the best technology & a diverse and award winning team - this role offers a GENUINE remote working policy. What does that mean? How does 5 days of work with the team per quarter sound (5 days of focused team events & an all-hands with some activities dotted in there)? Doesn't get more remote than that!

What do you need to posses to succeed here?
Masters or PhD in STEM focus with a minimum of 3+ years of hands-on data science experience
Experience in data frameworks & platforms such as Spark or KNIME
Hands-on programming in Python or Scala or Java etc.
Agile approach - hugely team focused - the ability to take a piece of work and see it applied to other areas of product
A client / product obsessed mindset -> driving iterations to deliver value to product and ultimately to the end user
