What's the opportunity? ü§î

At Intercom, you will be a product engineer - someone who solves real customer problems through a smart and efficient application of your technical knowledge and your tools. You‚Äôll be part of one of our multidisciplinary product teams, where you will build both back-end and front-end systems, and work closely with designers, product managers, researchers, and data analysts.

Our growth rate is faster than almost every other Saas company, ever and we‚Äôve recently announced a $125 million Series D investment round. We‚Äôre facing many exciting scaling challenges and we‚Äôre building a robust platform where your expertise can be applied to areas such as building a beautiful messenger composer, rule matching, deliverability, security, app availability and machine learning, to name a few.

What will I be doing? üöÄ

As An Experienced Engineer You Will
Develop technical plans and contribute to our technical architecture as we scale our products to serve tens of millions of people every day.
Write Ruby code, which knits together a lot of AWS, infrastructure, platform and SaaS technologies that form the core of Intercom‚Äôs backend infrastructure
Ship a change to production on your first day and a feature in your first week. That ‚Äúday one‚Äù change is automatically deployed to production along with 100 other deployments (on average) each weekday
Grow your team‚Äôs capacity by mentoring other engineers and interviewing candidates. This is a chance to be an integral part of building and growing a team.
What skills do I need? üìñ
2+ years of industry experience in a software engineering role, preferably building a SaaS product. You can demonstrate significant impact that your work has had on the product and/or the team.
Deep knowledge of a high-level programming language (for example, Ruby, Python, Javascript etc.) but it doesn‚Äôt need to be a language that we use here! Great people are effective and learn what we use quickly (or introduce us to better ways of working)
Experience collaborating directly with product teams and designers, and a proven track record of delivering value to customers or users. Engineers at Intercom are pragmatists who work closely with others on cross-disciplinary teams
Experience with Distributed systems
What happens when I apply? ü§ì

First, apply so we can review your CV :) As the next step, we will send you our take-home test to work on in your own time. You can find more details on the questions and how we evaluate answers here. The following step will be a phone interview with one of our engineers which will focus on technical and culture contribution questions (this step is sometimes broken down into 2 interviews). The final step is a virtual onsite interview.
