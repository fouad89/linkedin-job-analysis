Job Description & Summary

In an increasingly digitised world, instances of fraud and electronic crime are becoming more and more common. Forensic Data Analytics involves the analysis of data in order to discover meaningful patterns, measure historic events or predict the likelihood of future ones. Much of our work requires us to analyse vast quantities of electronic data, using cutting edge technology and advanced statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights for our worldwide clients. Typically, our work centres on the analysis of large volumes of electronic data, and because we operate in an environment where speed of response is often critical to our clients, we are constantly innovating and drawing on the very latest technologies.

Our graduate training programme is underpinned by a development framework that broadens and deepens your knowledge. You'll learn from hands-on coaching and an outstanding variety of work, picking up business, personal and technical skills you can use across the network, and throughout your career.

You could be looking for hidden patterns within the global payments of a bank accused of money laundering, searching for evidence of fraud and abuse within a companyâ€™s finance system or helping to identify illegal activity within millions of transactions. You may also be researching new tools and technologies and developing new propositions to take to our clients.

As a valued member of the team you will gain exposure to a wide variety of analytical techniques, providing you with a solid foundation for your career in data analytics.
