Information Fusion & Data Science Consultant
Frazer-Nash Consultancy
Warrington, England, United Kingdom
Description

Our people are at the very heart of what we do, they are the reason our clients work with us to solve some of their greatest challenges. At Frazer-Nash, we want all of our people to feel they belong, confident in the knowledge that we value and respect the commitment they have made by entrusting their careers and expertise to us. We are committed to fostering a working culture that brings out the very best in our people, regardless of their circumstances, identity or background. We want our people to be themselves, feel empowered to achieve their personal and professional goals, and know that we respect the unique value they bring to the company. In support of this, we encourage thoughtful behaviours and work to foster a collaborative working environment.

We are aiming to grow our capability to deliver C4ISR research for Defence applications.

To meet this aim, we are seeking experienced, talented individuals, who aspire to improve intelligence gathering through the application of cutting-edge technologies and techniques, as enablers to improving the situational awareness and foresight of the UKâ€™s intelligence analysts and armed forces.

Successful candidates will have a deep technical background in a relevant area, such as knowledge graphs, ontology development, natural language processing, data science and/or intelligence fusion. Experience of planning, developing and testing intelligence processing techniques, technologies and supporting information systems in Defence projects would be advantageous.

The work the team is doing is varied, sometimes requiring a high-level view of capability and sometimes in the detail of an analytical process. We work closely with both our clients and suppliers to deliver the best outcomes.

Candidates should also have an aptitude to provide consultancy services to our wider client-base.

The role can be delivered from any of our various UK office locations working flexibly within virtual teams. Successful applicants can expect to have some need to support client meetings and on-site projects, as and when these occur, at MoD sites in Wiltshire/Hampshire/Dorset.
